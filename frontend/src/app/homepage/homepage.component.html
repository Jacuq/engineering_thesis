            <p>
                I'm a CS student from Wroc≈Çaw University of Technology. <br>
                My hobby is playing bass, so I know how difficult it can be to stick to learning theory 
            and how a good learning material/tool can boost your learning. For me such a tool was Rocksmith 2014 and it was one of the inspirations for this app.
